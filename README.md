# Capstone 2: Data Scientist Job Skill Analysis
An exploratory data analysis on data science job skills with a model for predicting the most important skills.

## Project Overview
_Data Scientist and Data Analyst jobs require a specialized set of skills. I want to identify the most in demand skills in the Glassdoor job descriptions for a Data Scientist and Data Analyst, so I know which ones  to focus on developing first to be a more highly rated candidate during my job search. Understanding where these jobs are located and in which industries will allow me to more efficiently focus my search in the appropriate state and industry to increase my odds of getting a job as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst._
